Here's where I'll work on implementations of number theory-based algorithms, before iteratively optimising them!

Currently, these include:

- Sieve of Eratosthenes (utilising numpy arrays and having a time complexity of 'O(n log log n)')

- Sieve of Atkin ('O(n / log log n)')

- Sieve of Sundaram ('O(n log n)')

- Primality Checker ('O(sqrt(n))')
